My name is Mykyta. I was born in Ukraine and arrived in Canada a few months ago. My parents are still in Ukraine. I am 17 years old. I like how my studying at Fanshawe College is going. I like different sports such as basketball, soccer, volleyball. In Ukraine I used to do rowing. As hobby, I like watching anime series and ride on my bike. My favourite film is "IT", because I love scary films and this one is the best for me.
