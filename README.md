# Mykyta Buria

My name is Mykyta but you can also call me Nikita because it is a similar name. I am from Ukraine and arrived in Canada three months ago. I used to do rowing in Ukraine so I was a professional rower. I like watching anime, different series and films, I like basketball and volleyball. Now I am studying in the Interactive Media Design and I love it because of programs and programming languages which I am going to learn.  

# Ezra Carriere

My name is Ezra Carriere. I am 18 years old, born and raised in London, Ontario. For my entire life I have always loved soccer. Growing up and playing across the province gave me some of my favourite memories in life. Another one of my passions is film. I love watching and assessing all different kinds of movies. Being at Fanshawe in the Interactive Media Design program has been very enjoybale so far and I am really looking forward to the next couple years of school!
