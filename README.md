## Ezra Carriere
My name is Ezra Carriere. I was born in London Ontario on December 4th 2003. I am currently enrolled in the Interactive Media Design program at Fanshawe College. Outside of school, my biggest hobby is watching and playing soccer or watching films. My favourite film of all time is Ratatouille and in soccer I support Manchester United.
